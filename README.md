# Unsolved Problems & Major Hurdles
**Time Constraints**

Despite my lax deadline, I struggled to get everything I wanted in my portfolio. I've nevertheless met my specifications, which I'm certainly proud of myself for, and I think this experience has taught me a valuable lesson about using my time wisely and cutting losses when you can.

**IP Visuals**

I had originally intended for my "My IPs" section of the "My Work" page to have animated responsive gifs of the characters in each of my works, but it became clear I wouldn't have had nearly enough time for this idea. Hopefully I will be able to iterate this in a future update.
